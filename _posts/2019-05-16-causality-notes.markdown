These are my notes on causality.

# Concepts
Ladder of Causation - Association (seeing), Intervention (doing), Counterfactuals (imagining).


# Ideas & Intuitions
- Properties that remain invariant across environments are related to causation.
- If we identify a property that doesn't change across environments we can predict in new environments and perform well.
- The property will usually don't be a feature in our dataset but instead a function of several features ($\phi$ is a mapping between the feature space and the invariant properties). 
- Statistical Learning is about association, Causal Learning is about association, intervention and counterfactuals.
